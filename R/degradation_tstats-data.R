#' Degradation time t-statistics
#'
#' These t-statistics are derived from the same data that was used for
#' [rse_tx]. They are the results from main model where we determined
#' the relationship with degradation time adjusting for the brain region (so
#' parallel degradation effects across brain regions). They are used for
#' plotting in `DEqual()`.
